Seattle U, CPSC 5011, Section 1, Fall Quarter 2018 -- Class Development

We will use this repository for
* Projects we work on during class lab sessions
* Work students do in class then submit for code review by committing code
* Code associated with homework assignments
  * The assignments themselves will be in Canvas, and you will submit solutions in Canvas
  
If possible, we will try to respect the structure of one directory per class session.
Except for this file.  Within each directory we will subdivide according to content type, and then 
when you submit code written individually or by a group, you will create another directory identifying the individual or group.
So expect a lot of directory structure.

At least for now we will work only in the master branch.  Having individuals work in branches then merge is just asking for time-consuming and heartbreaking merge conflicts.  And who needs that?
